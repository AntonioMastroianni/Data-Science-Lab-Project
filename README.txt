## About

This project proposes a novel strategy to address nutrition deprivation in Belize by leveraging housing data as a proxy for identifying high-need areas. Direct nutrition data can often be sparse, outdated, or difficult to localize. By analyzing Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) data—covering dimensions such as housing, sanitation, and education—we establish a strong statistical relationship between housing conditions and nutritional deprivation.

Key analyses include odds ratio evaluations, logistic regression with confounding adjustment, and a spatial focus on the Toledo district, identified as the most housing-deprived and nutrition-vulnerable region. We estimate the scope of investment needed for nutritional aid and propose an annual food assistance plan based on household size and MPI indicators.

This data-driven approach supports more efficient humanitarian interventions by enabling organizations to act where both poverty and malnutrition are most concentrated, despite challenges in collecting direct nutrition data.
